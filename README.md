# Book summarization webapp

This is a simple Flask app to accompany my exploration of [automatic
summaraization of novels](https://github.com/brmdv/usecase-summarization).

## Demo
Live demo is hosted on Heroku. 

<https://brams-book-summarizer.herokuapp.com>


## Included books
Some books are already predownloaded from Project Gutenberg, in the directory
_books/_. If you want to add/remove any book, you'll have to rerun the script
[booklist.py](bookllist.py), to generate _books/books.json_.
